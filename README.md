# Alex's neovim

This is shamelessly stolen from:
- https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim
It has been adapted to work with nixos.

## Setup

> **NOTE**
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

External Requirements:
- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- python
- nodejs with npm.

Once you start you need to run
`:Copilot auth`
to set up copilot.
